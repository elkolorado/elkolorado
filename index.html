                  <h2>About</h2>
                  <p>In an era in which the paper is more valuable than knowledge, this project should serve as inspiration, the aim of which is the constant pursuit of the unknown.</p>
                  <p>Game is finite. By that meaning, everything can be counted, documented and photographed.</p>
                  <p>Ideas are infinite. We could endlessly sit and think about them.</p>
                  <p>We must stop the never-ending brainstorming of inventing new ideas. To obtain that we need to attach theories to ideas. Theories which follow ideas can test usefulness of them. For years we were trying to guess solution. Current problem show that after players find a new idea, they often leave it on that level, not even trying to test it in game. If they would do this, they would eliminate theory attached to idea, slowly weakening, and possibly eliminating it from other ones.</p>
                  <!-- <p>To visualise problem think of needle in a haystack. Trying to find needle by pure luck is almost impossible. You need to search for it in few places to higher your chances for finding it, however it is still possible. Now think of second option, where you could remove single hay and put it away. This method is extreamly time consuming, but it will guarantee victory, while compared to first one, we could possibly never find needle in haystack. This is what we need to try to achieve. Slowly remove ideas, to get closer to final one, which would lead us to ultimate solution. </p> -->
                  <p>The method that has been used through years is even worse than we all think. Even that we were trying to guess solution, we weren't even sharing our attemps. By tha mean, huge amount of players were trying the same idea over and over again, where few players already knew it wouldn't work. Enormous time wasted among all players, by not exchanging informations, by not collecting facts, data, images, transcriptions and references. </p>
                  <p>Reason for this could be simple. Outdated databases. Lack of forums, threads, posts. Players can't find new theories, cause they aren't written down by anyone. I will try to show you, how many things aren't documented. And I will only do it on example of Serpentine Tower. </p>
